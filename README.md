# ee component test

## Task:
Please implement the following design with HTML/CSS, in a React project. The design should be responsive and work on different devices/browsers.

When a blog card is clicked, a React state, or context setting, or cookie should be updated to show the user has clicked an article. How you display this is up to you, but you are not required to create a full blog article page or anything like that.
Make sure to handle the hover state of the blog card
This section must loop through a data array of some sort so that only a single “card component” is used by each iteration of the loop

## Notes:
- responsive: 1-column, 2-column, and 3-column layout
- state: "active article" when clicked on "READ MORE" button. Sample
  article-reader at the bottom.
- hover: implemented the colored-image on hover feature only on the 1st
  image as an example since it was the only colored image provided. it's
  only a css hover effect, however, i can also store the currently
  hovered article as state if needed.
